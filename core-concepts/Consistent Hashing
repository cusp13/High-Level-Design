## 🧩 What Problem Consistent Hashing Solves

When you have **multiple servers or shards**, you need a way to decide **where each data item goes** — e.g.,
“Which cache node stores this user’s session?”
“Which DB shard stores this user’s order?”

The **naive way** (like `hash(key) % N`) fails badly when:

* You **add** a node (N changes → all data remapped)
* You **remove** a node (crash → all data remapped again)

Result: **massive data reshuffling** → poor performance and downtime.

✅ **Consistent Hashing** fixes this by **minimizing data movement** when nodes are added or removed.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Imagine a **hash ring (0 to 2³² - 1)** arranged in a circle:

1. Every **server (or shard)** is placed on the ring using a hash of its name.

   ```
   hash("DB1") → position 1000
   hash("DB2") → position 20000
   hash("DB3") → position 40000
   ```

2. Every **data item (key)** is also hashed onto the same ring.

   ```
   hash("user123") → position 15000
   ```

3. The item is stored on the **next node clockwise** on the ring.
   → Here, 15000 goes to DB2.

So, each node is responsible for the range between its predecessor and itself.

## 🧮 When Adding or Removing Nodes

* If you **add** a node, say `DB4` → only data that falls between the previous node and `DB4`’s position needs to move.
* If you **remove** a node → only data on that node’s range gets reassigned.

Instead of **rebalancing everything**, you only **move a small fraction of data**.

That’s the magic.

## 🌀 Virtual Nodes (vNodes)

To prevent **uneven load distribution**, each physical node is assigned **multiple positions** (virtual nodes) on the ring:

Example:

```
DB1 → hash("DB1#1"), hash("DB1#2"), hash("DB1#3")
DB2 → hash("DB2#1"), hash("DB2#2"), hash("DB2#3")
```

If a node fails, its load is spread more evenly across others.
👉 The **more virtual nodes**, the **better balance**.

## 💡 Real-World Examples

| System                              | Where Consistent Hashing is Used | Why                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**                 | Distributes partitions           | Handle node joins/leaves without rebalancing whole cluster |
| **Apache Cassandra**                | Data distribution across ring    | Scalable peer-to-peer architecture                         |
| **Redis Cluster**                   | Keyslot allocation               | Scale horizontally with minimal rebalance                  |
| **CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai)** | Cache selection                  | Pick nearest edge node deterministically                   |

## 🧠 In Interviews: When to Mention It

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Distributed Cache (e.g., Redis Cluster)** | “To map keys to cache nodes efficiently, I’d use consistent hashing to minimize cache invalidation when nodes are added or removed.” |
| **Sharded DB Design**                       | “Instead of modulo-based sharding, I’d use consistent hashing for dynamic scaling and minimal data movement.”                        |
| **Load Balancing / Message Queues**         | “We can use consistent hashing to route requests/messages to the same worker, ensuring locality and cache reuse.”                    |

## ⚔️ Consistent Hashing vs Modulo Hashing

| Feature              | Modulo Hashing         | Consistent Hashing       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Adding/Removing Node | Redistributes all keys | Redistributes few keys   |
| Load Balance         | Often uneven           | Even with vNodes         |
| Implementation       | Simple                 | Slightly more complex    |
| Used In              | Small, static clusters | Scalable dynamic systems |

## 🧩 Example Analogy

Think of a **clock** with **12 hours** and 3 servers:

* Server A → 12
* Server B → 4
* Server C → 8

Each “data item” is a time on the clock, and it belongs to the **next server clockwise**.

If you add a new server at “2”, only items between 12 → 2 move.
Everything else stays put.
That’s **consistent hashing** — move only what you must.
